## Feedback to Implement

1. use of inline styles mixed with CSS classes does not make for clear, readable code
2. good componentisation but his coding structure makes me think in a bigger codebase his code would be a bit messy. He's not separating concerns, using instead big blocks of returns
3. UX is not optimal (i.e. in the search results, there is no way to see - at a glance - what characters have already been added. The user must instead click on the character card first). This is in spite of having used a 3rd party library to speed up the UI implementation
